# PyQJsonModel
JSON Tree Model inspired by https://github.com/dridk/QJsonModel


Little helper classes for displaying JSON Data in a QTreeModel. Just run the File for a Demo. Use this model together with JSON-data as binary, from a file or a dict as data-source.

`QJsonModel - update_data(json_dict_or_filename)
` now supports json-data, a dict or a filename.

You need Python3(>=.7) and PySide2 (>=5.14) installed. This is what I used at the moment of coding. Could also work in other configurations.
